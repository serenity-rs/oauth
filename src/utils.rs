/// Creates a URL for a simple bot authorization flow.

/// This is a special,
/// server-less and callback-less OAuth2 flow that makes it
/// easy for users to add bots to guilds.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create an authorization URL for a bot requiring the "Add Reactions" and
/// "Send Messages" permissions:
///
/// ```rust
///
/// # fn main() {
/// use serenity_oauth::utils::Permissions;
///
/// let client_id = 249608697955745802;
/// let required = Permissions::ADD_REACTIONS | Permissions::SEND_MESSAGES;
/// let url = serenity_oauth::utils::bot_authorization_url(client_id, required);
///
/// // Assert that the expected URL is correct.
/// let expected = "https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=249608697955745802&scope=bot&permissions=2112";
/// assert_eq!(url, expected);
/// # }

/// Creates a URL for an authorization code grant.
///
/// This will create a URL to redirect the user to, requesting the given scopes
/// for your client ID.
///
/// The given `redirect_uri` will automatically be URL encoded.
///
/// A state _should_ be passed, as recommended by RFC 6749. It is a unique
/// identifier for the user's request. When Discord redirects the user to the
/// given redirect URI, it will append a `state` parameter to the query. It will
/// match the state that you have recorded for that user. If it does not, there
/// was likely a request interception.
///
/// As well as the callback URL having the same `state` appended in the query
/// parameters, this will also append a `code`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Produce an authorization code grant URL for your client, requiring the
/// [`Scope::Identify`] and [`Scope::GuildsJoin`] scopes, and an example of a
/// state:
///
/// **Note**: Please randomly generate this using a crate like `rand`.
///
/// ```rust
/// use serenity_oauth::Scope;
///
/// let client_id = 249608697955745802;
/// let scopes = [Scope::GuildsJoin, Scope::Identify];
/// let state = "15773059ghq9183habn";
/// let redirect_uri = "https://myapplication.website";
///
/// let url = serenity_oauth::utils::authorization_code_grant_url(
///     client_id,
///     &scopes,
///     Some(state),
///     redirect_uri,
